**Extensible** ERC721 with a Built-in Commit-Reveal Scheme.

## Overview

Mints suck...

They're difficult to mint, oft impossible.
The mint price is fixed - artists and creators don't realize upside.

Is this fixable?

Honestly, not without tradeoffs.

Cloaks sacrifices ordering (first-come first-serve) for price-discovery and gas efficiency.

_How_ does this work?

When a mint process begins, cloaks enables a commit session, that lasts for an arbitrarily long period to prevent gas wars. During the commit session, users can `commit()` a hidden price they value the ERC721 at.



///// TODO

Users must provide a deposit (of amount `minPrice`) to `commit()` in a mint.

If a user gets an allocation for their price and forgo a mint, they suffer a penalty
on their deposit proportional to how close the `resultPrice` is to their `providedPrice`.

## Development

[Cloak](https://github.com/abigger87/cloak) is an extensible ERC721 implementation with a commit-reveal scheme built _into_ the ERC721 contract itself.
The only contract is located in [src/](./src/) called [Cloak](./src/Cloak.sol).

Both [DappTools](https://dapp.tools/) and [Foundry](https://github.com/gaskonst/foundry) are supported. Installation instructions for both are included below.

#### Install DappTools

Install DappTools using their [installation guide](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools#installation).

#### First time with Forge/Foundry?

See the official Foundry installation [instructions](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/blob/master/README.md#installation).

Don't have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed?
Run
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then, install the [foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) toolchain installer (`foundryup`) with:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Now that you've installed the `foundryup` binary,
anytime you need to get the latest `forge` or `cast` binaries,
you can run `foundryup`.

So, simply execute:
```bash
foundryup
```

ðŸŽ‰ Foundry is installed! ðŸŽ‰

#### Setup

```bash
make
# OR #
make setup
```

#### Build

```bash
make build
```

#### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

#### Configure Foundry

Using [foundry.toml](./foundry.toml), Foundry is easily configurable.
